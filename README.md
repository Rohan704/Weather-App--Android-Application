# Weather-App--Android-Application

 As we know that a forecast is one of the major functions of weather apps. It shows the prediction for the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly forecast along with the present situation of the weather. What's more, you can integrate an additional feature known as 'Real Feel' to shows the 'feel like' temperature.
 I build this weather-application using Android stude with the help of API https://openweathermap.org/ this give us access to a certain build file that allow us to display current temperature of current weather on our application.
 
 # Implementation
 I have implementated this  API through retrofit library.
